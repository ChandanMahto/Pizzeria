"# Pizzeria" 

The application I developed when I was going through the training back in 2022. The aim was to understand and implement the basic CRUD principle along with the power of Angular.

Honestly, I don't even remember, why I created few methods or why I took some approach. There are few approach which are beginner. If you will go through the code you will also feel the same. I am trying to change few approaches whenever I get some time. If you are following this, and feel that some change can be done, feel free to do so, or drop a request.




### Steps to run the application locally ###

1. go to the backend and frontend folders, and perform npm i
2. start mongodb server
	create data folder -> c:\data\db
    and start the server
    open mongodb compass, and create a new collection named "Pizzeria"
    import "pizza" and "ingredients" into Pizzeria


3. open backend folder in terminal and run it using "nodemon start"

4. opne frontend folder in terminal and run it using "ng serve -o".

you can now see the application running in localhost:4200
